                  <br>
                  We’re trying to replace Dixie.
                  <br>
                  Your name doesn’t have to be Dixie.  You don’t have to be 65 years young like the
                  woman we hired named Dixie who was with us for six years before she left to go to the
                  US and start her own business.  You don’t have to work only mornings and refuse to
                  drive all over the lower mainland like Dixie did.  Nor must you have the best writing
                  skills EVER, as Dixie had.
                  <br>
                  What you DO need is the drive and ability to make contacts, build relation-ships and
                  close business, just like Dixie did.
                  <br>
                  Has your career as a professional sales person in your last position wound down?
                  Would you like to work in a part-time customer account position with a 35 year old
                  Vancouver based company doing business in more than 70 offices around the world?
                  We’re <i>Priority Management</i>, a company delivering effectiveness and productivity
                  training to small and large businesses, organizations of all descriptions and to different
                  levels of government.  And we are looking for an individual to represent us in the lower
                  mainland.
                  <br>
                  We are well respected in the industry and known to offer a premium product at a
                  premium price.  Our market is growing and we are looking for individuals who love
                  talking to people, uncovering their needs and helping them find solutions.
                  Join our dynamic team and stay active in business at your own pace, with like-minded
                  people who really make a difference in their customers’ lives.
